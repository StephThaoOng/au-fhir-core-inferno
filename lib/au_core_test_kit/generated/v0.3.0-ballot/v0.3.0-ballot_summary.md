# AU CORE v0.3.0-ballot


## Patient Tests

<details>
<summary>Verify support for the server capabilities required by the AU Core Patient.</summary>

# Background

The AU Core Patient sequence verifies that the system under test is
able to provide correct responses for Patient queries. These queries
must contain resources conforming to the AU Core Patient as
specified in the AU Core v0.3.0-ballot Implementation Guide.

# Testing Methodology
## Searching
This test sequence will first perform each required search associated
with this resource. This sequence will perform searches with the
following parameters:

* _id
* identifier

### Search Parameters
The first search uses the selected patient(s
</details>

### Tests

1. Server returns valid results for Patient search by _id
<details>
<summary>Show details</summary>
A server SHALL support searching by
_id on the Patient resource. This test
will pass if resources are returned and match the search criteria. If
none are returned, the test is skipped.

Because this is the first search of the sequence, resources in the
response will be used for subsequent tests.

Additionally, this test will check that GET and POST search methods
return the same number of results. Search by POST is required by the
FHIR R4 specification, and these tests interpret search by GET as a
requirement of AU Core v0.3.0-ballot.

response will be used for subsequent tests.

Additionally, this test will check that GET and POST search methods
return the same number of results. Search by POST is required by the
FHIR R4 specification, and these tests interpret search by GET as a
requirement of AU Core v0.3.0-ballot.

## Observation Waist Circumference Tests

<details>
<summary>Verify support for the server capabilities required by the AU Core Waist Circumference.</summary>

# Background

The AU Core Observation Waist Circumference sequence verifies that the system under test is
able to provide correct responses for Observation queries. These queries
must contain resources conforming to the AU Core Waist Circumference as
specified in the AU Core v0.3.0-ballot Implementation Guide.

# Testing Methodology
## Searching
This test sequence will first perform each required search associated
with this resource. This sequence will perform searches with the
following parameters:

* patient + code
* patient
* patient + category
* patient + category + date
* patient + category + status

### Search Parameters
The first search uses the selected patient(s
</details>

### Tests

1. Server returns valid results for Observation search by patient + code
<details>
<summary>Show details</summary>
A server SHALL support searching by
patient + code on the Observation resource. This test
will pass if resources are returned and match the search criteria. If
none are returned, the test is skipped.

This test verifies that the server supports searching by reference using
the form `patient=[id]` as well as `patient=Patient/[id]`. The two
different forms are expected to return the same number of results. US
Core requires that both forms are supported by AU Core responders.

Because this is the first search of the sequence, resources in the
response will be used for subsequent tests.

Additionally, this test will check that GET and POST search methods
return the same number of results. Search by POST is required by the
FHIR R4 specification, and these tests interpret search by GET as a
requirement of AU Core v0.3.0-ballot.

## Immunization Tests

<details>
<summary>Verify support for the server capabilities required by the AU Core Immunization.</summary>

# Background

The AU Core Immunization sequence verifies that the system under test is
able to provide correct responses for Immunization queries. These queries
must contain resources conforming to the AU Core Immunization as
specified in the AU Core v0.3.0-ballot Implementation Guide.

# Testing Methodology
## Searching
This test sequence will first perform each required search associated
with this resource. This sequence will perform searches with the
following parameters:

* patient
* patient + status

### Search Parameters
The first search uses the selected patient(s
</details>

### Tests

1. Server returns valid results for Immunization search by patient
<details>
<summary>Show details</summary>
A server SHALL support searching by
patient on the Immunization resource. This test
will pass if resources are returned and match the search criteria. If
none are returned, the test is skipped.

This test verifies that the server supports searching by reference using
the form `patient=[id]` as well as `patient=Patient/[id]`. The two
different forms are expected to return the same number of results. US
Core requires that both forms are supported by AU Core responders.

Because this is the first search of the sequence, resources in the
response will be used for subsequent tests.

Additionally, this test will check that GET and POST search methods
return the same number of results. Search by POST is required by the
FHIR R4 specification, and these tests interpret search by GET as a
requirement of AU Core v0.3.0-ballot.

## Organization Tests

<details>
<summary>Verify support for the server capabilities required by the AU Core Organization.</summary>

# Background

The AU Core Organization sequence verifies that the system under test is
able to provide correct responses for Organization queries. These queries
must contain resources conforming to the AU Core Organization as
specified in the AU Core v0.3.0-ballot Implementation Guide.

# Testing Methodology
## Searching
This test sequence will first perform each required search associated
with this resource. This sequence will perform searches with the
following parameters:

* address
* identifier
* name

### Search Parameters
The first search uses the selected patient(s
</details>

### Tests

1. Server returns correct Organization resource from Organization read interaction
<details>
<summary>Show details</summary>
A server SHALL support the Organization read interaction.
</details>


2. Server returns valid results for Organization search by _id
<details>
<summary>Show details</summary>
A server SHOULD support searching by
_id on the Organization resource. This test
will pass if resources are returned and match the search criteria. If
none are returned, the test is skipped.

Because this is the first search of the sequence, resources in the
response will be used for subsequent tests.

Additionally, this test will check that GET and POST search methods
return the same number of results. Search by POST is required by the
FHIR R4 specification, and these tests interpret search by GET as a
requirement of AU Core v0.3.0-ballot.
