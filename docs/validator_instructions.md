# Step-by-Step Guide to Using the FHIR Resources Validator
## Several steps are involved in using the FHIR resources validator:

1. Paste the complete target resource in **JSON** format into the text input field.
2. Click the **"Advanced"** button to open advanced options for the validator.
3. Use the **"Pick an Implementation Guide to validate against:"** option to select **"hl7.fhir.au.core."**
4. Use the **"Select a profile:"** option to choose the target profile for validation.

Once you have configured the validator, you can initiate the validation process. Please press the **"Validate"** button.

As a result, you will see a page displaying **issues, warnings, and other relevant information** about the resource you validated.
